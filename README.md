 TDD Methodology Workshop

## Task
Write a function to determine whether a year is **leap** or not, following these rules:

1. **Years divisible by 400** -> `True`
   - Example: Year **2000**

2. **Years divisible by 100 but not by 400** -> `False`
   - Examples: Years **1700**, **1800**, **1900**

3. **Years divisible by 4 but not by 100** -> `True`
   - Examples: Years **2008**, **2012**, **2016**

4. **Years not divisible by 4** -> `False`
   - Examples: Years **2017**, **2018**, **2019**

## How to Solve
Use **TDD** (Test-Driven Development) to approach the problem.

### Important Note
The order in which you select the tests **influences the solution**.
